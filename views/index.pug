				p
					| We hope that all our local supporters are coping in the current 'Lockdown'. Macmillan have decided that no 'face-to-face' fundraising should take place until after 31st July as it is prudent and responsible to protect our supporters and volunteers at this difficult time. We are very sad that we have been unable to host our annual Plant Sale, which is such a highlight of our fundraising year, but will be back with our local events as soon as possible. There is full advice on contacting Macmillan on health issues at

					| Meanwhile, today we've had some wonderful news from 'The Victoria' in West Temple Sheen. They have always been generous supporters of our local Macmillan Committee, and have regularly hosted our annual lunch event. Like all restaurants / pubs they are closed for normal business but have just started a 'take-away' service. They are donating all their proceeds from last week and next to Macmillan. So if you fancy a real takeaway treat, please send them an email at
